Description: Robust inference/testing of treatment effects under covariate-adaptive randomization. The package implements three estimators, that are model-free and generally applicable under many covariate-adaptive randomization methods, including the minimization, stratified permuted block, stratified biased coin, and stratified urn design; see Ye et al. (2020).
