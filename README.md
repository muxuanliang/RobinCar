# RobinCar ROBust INference for average treatment effect under Covariate-Adaptive Randomizations
Robust inference/testing of treatment effects under covariate-adaptive randomization. The package implements three estimators, that are model-free and generally applicable under many covariate-adaptive randomization methods, including the minimization, stratified permuted block, stratified biased coin, and stratified urn design; see Ye et al. (2020).

## Setup
To install the most up-to-date version, run the following command in R

```
library(devtools)
install_github("tye27/RobinCar")
```
